  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    My design process initially started with drawing of a circular oval head, wide eyes, eyebrows, a sprout for hair, ears, and a tongue licking upwards. 
    My inspiration was from this popular japanese girl on the front of milky candy named Peko-Chan. Growing up, this brand was essential to my childhood. 
    I also loved using this expression ":p or :q" in my daily life texting, so I thought I would try to incorporate those into this assignment. Ive discovered 
    that during this process, I first made the 2D face by having a rough idea of where to place everything. I was intially going to have stars for the eyes, but 
    settled for diamonds instead. The second step came harder, which was using the different elements such as user defining variables, mouseX, mouseY. I found out 
    that in order to make everything move together as one, I had to individually do the points and define them, the incorporate it in relation to the main head's 
    movement that follows the mouse. Additionally, I ran into some problems with the key and mouse press that would result in random colors. I struggled quite a bit 
    because I kept on putting the function into draw when it was suppose to be outside, as well as issues with bracket placement that would result in my sketch not working
    properly. Ive discovered, through this assignment, that because I didn't put the center element before I inputed all the elements and their coordinates, I was unable to 
    change it so that it can expand throughout the page. Additionally, because I chose a face with more elements, I needed to code in relation so it moves together.
