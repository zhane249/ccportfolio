    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I came to the US after moving from Canada in the 6th grade, and contined normal public middle and highschool education. During this time I have always kept art as more of a hobby, and didn't even consider design. Instead I was on track for premed in my IB Diploma program but switched to plan b in my sophmore year and focused on creating my portfolio. During this period I have been receiving teachings from a local studio art teacher once every week, but after </p>

    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>In my spare time, I still use my fine art origins and utilize my skills and experimented further with wood, acrylic plexiglass, plaster, and 3D printing. Within the digital world, I am particularly interested in digital product design and hoping to go into the UX UI field.</p>

    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>Right now I am just trying to push out portfolio pieces, and build a website to send out to internships, but I do hope that eventually I will be able to work in corporate and perhaps physical computing.</p>

    <h2>Reflections on Technology & Coding</h2>
    <p>
      Within my artworks, I always strive to make the main element of the piece --- storytelling. No matter what project or exhibition it is, for every single art piece there needed to be a meaning, a reason for why it was created : to make the audience question, to spark debate, to feel. I am consistently inspired by the human anatomy itself, questioning the role of technology in human evolution. I derive my inspiration from elements in my past. For example, the fairytales that was read to me as a child birthed an entire series, purely focusing on twisting the old tales to create new perspectives that often questions if there were other solutions or ways to approach a singular topic. For technology and code, I am particularly intrigued by interaction design, digital product design, and human-computer interaction. In addition, currently I also have work that explore human augmentation and the synthetic biology.
