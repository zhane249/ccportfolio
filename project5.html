  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    My concept for this project was to create a custom print for families. 
    This print design is unique, one of a kind, and can be hung in a family home as a painting 
    or on clothing as a new matching clothes. It can also be used for couples too. But the initial design
    was for families with young children, because of their small hands, the small flowers could be a way 
    of remembering a child's growth, alongside their parents' hands. I ran into numerous challenges doing
    this project. As I was insistent on utilizing the motion capture function, I realized that I had to create 
    two canvases, one for the camera and one for the print canvas, so viewers could see themselves performing the task.
    And when I found the p5js reference for multiple canvases, the website kept crashing as a result because the code kept 
    trying to run before everything was load. And then finally when the canvas 1 was working, canvas 2's nightmare began.
    Because of the specific vision I had in mind, I actually wrote several versions of the sketch. The first edition the 
    triangle did rotate and change color, but there was only one and it didn't layer. The second one the screen would refresh
    so it paints over the flower already drawn. The third one had rotating triangles with layers but it would only follow 
    one hand. Long story short, I had a lot of trouble because of typos, calculation errors, etc. I would say I designed 
    this optical illusion to be utilized in a free browser/app that will result in a pdf/image for prints or directly imported
    into a graphic design for wearables.
