  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
  My idea was to combine my AI ULEC paper with this game project. “Accept All Cookies”. 
  That was a term that is hurled at every website user in the 21st century. Cookies essentially 
  are “small files of information that a web server generates and sent to a web browser…then stored
  for a predetermined period of time, or for the length of a user’s session on a website. They attach
  the relevant cookies to any future requests the user makes of the web server.” 1 By tracking, the
  website remembers the interests and information of that user and modifies its contents accordingly. 
  Many users don't even realize the extent of the private information they allow cookies to track due 
  to the intentional UX design of the pop-up. I personally relate to this as well. Before my research, 
  I had clicked on “Accept Cookies” on almost every website I visited. I had attempted to read the terms
  and conditions occasionally, but without extensive knowledge of the topic, I would resort to going with the
  convenient option of accepting all cookies. In reality, this habitual acceptance was not of the user’s free
  will, but instead the result of intentional UX/UI decisions that are designed to guide the user using the human
  tendency to choose shortcuts, and lack patience, resulting in unknowingly choosing compliance while being under
  the pretense they had the freedom of choice. I coin this phenomenon as cookie-ism: the normalization of passive, 
  performative consent designed by utilizing human behavioral psychology to use as a loophole for consent online. 
  So I decided to make this game that is a play on how normalized the pop ups and cookies today because it plays on
  human's habits of relying on convenience. The main objective of the game is to find the “Deny All Cookies” button, 
  while the system tries to persuade the user through manipulative language, utilizing deceptive patterns such as
  obstruction and nagging. I will be utilizing AI statements in my code to convince the user to click the
  “Agree All Cookies” button.
