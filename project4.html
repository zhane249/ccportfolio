  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
The Zombiant comes from a peashooter head and got zombified when he was fallen in battle, he gained the power to change one part of 
his body after he stumbled upon a wizard's grave. As hes on his last breath he turned to grab anything that was alive beside him, 
and it was actually a chicken who's wondered too far. He can only replace the part of his body that is the same part as the living being. 
To hide the part where it has the drastic color changes, he took an abandoned lifeguard tube. It also helps him to go into other territory
like water, as the tube helps him float even if he has just one limb.
