  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
   I named my clock Spine Disk, because the idea behind its creation was something I've learned a long time ago: that because of gravity, 
    the height of humans change due to the disks in between our spines to be compressed throughout the day. That's why when we measure height,
    we are a tiny bit taller when we just wake up in the morning versus when we go to bed. So, in my family, there is a habit that when it comes 
    to measuring height growth, its always in the morning. Its something that I've always known, but it was only recently when I was in the process
    of making this clock that I found out its not exactly common knowledge, seeing the surprise on my peers' faces when I told them what was my inspiration. 
    My clock might alter the way I keep time because I definitely am more conscious about keeping track of what to use my hours for after I made this clock. 
    Although its at the pace of seconds instead of actual human compression that might be a few milimeters off at the end of the day, it lingers on my brain 
    and helps me not to procrasinate, as I become more aware of my body's changes throughout the day.
