  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
   My Data Portrait is me recording my personal habit of fidgeting with my rings when I am anxious. 
    Its become a habit of mine instead of scratching my hands or nails that causes actual damage, 
    I wear rings to get rid of the bad habit. I tracked a week worth of the 4 rings I wear on a daily, 
    and which ones I fidget with during what day. The instruction for the viewers is to see the color bars on 
    each finger. The viweers click on each of the days of the week at the top and it shows the amount of times 
    and the rings that I fidgeted with.
